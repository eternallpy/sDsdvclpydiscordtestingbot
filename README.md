# A discord bot which check the exchange rate of several currency
By using the basic function of selenium, this program is able to grab the exchange rate from HSBC website with a frequency of 30 minutes once.

Discord is used as an interface to control or view the currency exchange rate.

The program updates the rate every 30 minutes and changes the bot status every 5 seconds, which the status show the exchange rate.

This program followed the tutorial video of freeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

Replit is used to host the bot.

Approach in hosting the bot on a virtual machine have made but not successful due to of the chromewebdriver of selenium. (chromewebdriver does not support arm64 cpu which used in the virtual machine.) Approach were is still making in order to host it on some virtual machine and adding some interesting function to the bot.
